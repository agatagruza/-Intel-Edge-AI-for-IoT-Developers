Repo for Intel-Edge-AI-for-IoT-Developers Nanodegree by Intel

Edge AI applications are revolutionizing the IoT industry by bringing fast, intelligent behavior to the locations where it is needed. In this Nanodegree program, I have learnt how to develop and optimize Edge AI systems using Intel’s® OpenVINO™ toolkit and also how to utilize Intel’s® DevCloud platform to test different model configurations before  making any hardware purchase decision. As a graduate of this program, I am able to:
- Design, test, and deploy an edge AI application in any number of settings for a broad array of different companies, industries, and devices.
- Leverage the Intel® OpenVINO™ toolkit to fast-track the development of high-performance computer vision and deep learning inference applications.
- Run pre-trained deep learning models for computer vision on-prem.
- Identify key hardware specifications of various hardware types (CPU, VPU, FPGA, and Integrated GPU).
- Advanced optimiztion techniques to improve performance of the system.
- Utilize Intel's DevCloud to test model performance on various hardware types (CPU, VPU, FPGA, and Integrated GPU).
