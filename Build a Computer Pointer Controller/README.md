# Project: Build a Computer Pointer Controller :guardsman:


<img height="32" width="32" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@latest/icons/simpleicons.svg" /> <ins> **GOAL:** </ins></br> Use models available in the OpenVINOâ„¢ 
toolkit to control your computer pointer using your eye gaze.</br></br>

In this project, you will use a gaze detection model to control the mouse pointer of your computer. You will be using the 
[Gaze Estimation](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_gaze_estimation_adas_0002_description_gaze_estimation_adas_0002.html) model 
to estimate the gaze of the user's eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly. This project will demonstrate your ability to run multiple 
models in the same machine and coordinate the flow of data between those models.
